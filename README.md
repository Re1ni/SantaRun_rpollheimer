### Necessary setup/execution steps: 
For playing the game go to: 
* WebGL: https://hs-teaching.github.io/WegGL-SantaRun/
* Standalone (.exe): Clone project and publish as Standalone

For development: Clone this project. 

### Third party material: 
* This game is based on the game Santa Run developed by Raja Biswas in the Udemy-course Unity 2018 Game Developmen by Example 
[Unity 2018 Game Development by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-2d-game-development-by-example/).
* Sprites are used from https://www.gameart2d.com/santa-claus-free-sprites.html


### Project state: 
Program is working correctly, no errors, refactoring is needed.
Refactoring needed: 
* del not used namespaces
* del unused variables
* del needless debugs
* del needless comments
* del unused methods
* rename variables (coding standards)
* rename methods (coding standards)
* fix poor conditional clauses
* fix poor formating
* replace magic string
* replace magic number

### Limitations: 
Only one level is implemented. 

### Lessons Learned: 
* Create 2D Scenes
* Use Quads for moving Backgrounds (Textures instead of Sprites)
* Use Particle System for snowing effect.
* Use Scene Management for switching between Scenes
* Create and control Animations (Animation, Animator and Scripts)
* Use the singelton pattern
* Spawn objects
* Use UI elements and manipulate UI elements with scrips
